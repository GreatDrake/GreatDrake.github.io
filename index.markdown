Hello! I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/). I am also a researcher at [BayesGroup](https://bayesgroup.ru/), supervised by [Dmitry Vetrov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7HU0UoUAAAAJ&hl=en). Currently I am working on Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) and their connections to Reinforcement Learning. I've also previously worked on Neural Radiance Fields and text-to-3D generative models with [Kirill Struminsky](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q69zIO0AAAAJ&hl=en), as well as worked on Domain Generalization for my Bachelor's thesis. Generally speaking I am interested in probabilistic methods, generative modeling and computer vision.
