Hello! I am set to start my PhD in Fall 2024 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7HU0UoUAAAAJ&hl=en">Dmitry Vetrov</a> at <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/">HSE University</a>, where I have also been actively involved in research at <a href="https://bayesgroup.ru/">Bayesian Methods Research Group</a>. Currently, my research is focused on Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) and their connections to Reinforcement Learning. I am working towards creating new efficient GFlowNet training algorithms, as well as expanding the theoretical understanding of these models. Generally speaking, my research interests include generative modeling and probabilistic methods in deep learning. <br /> <br />
  
I have also previously worked on Neural Radiance Fields and text-to-3D generative models with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q69zIO0AAAAJ&hl=en">Kirill Struminsky</a>, as well as worked on Domain Generalization for my Bachelor's thesis. Prior to joining Bayesian Methods Research Group, I was a software engineer intern at <a href="https://yandex.com/company">Yandex</a>, where I worked on improving <a href="https://ytsaurus.tech/">YTsaurus</a> platform. <br /> <br />

I have a background in competitive programming, you can find me <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/madn">on codeforces</a>. Next September I will be participating in 2024 ICPC World Finals.
