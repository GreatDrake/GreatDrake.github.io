Hello! I am a 2nd year MSc student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/">HSE University</a>, actively involved in research at <a href="https://bayesgroup.ru/">Bayesian Methods Research Group</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7HU0UoUAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Dmitry Vetrov</a>. Currently, my research is focused on Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) and their connections to Reinforcement Learning. I am working towards creating new efficient GFlowNet training algorithms, as well as expanding the theoretical understanding of these models. I have also previously worked on Neural Radiance Fields and text-to-3D generative models with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q69zIO0AAAAJ&hl=en">Kirill Struminsky</a>, as well as worked on Domain Generalization for my Bachelor's thesis. Generally speaking, my research interests include generative modeling and probabilistic methods in deep learning.
