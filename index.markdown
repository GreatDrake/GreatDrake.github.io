<p>
Hello! I am a 2nd year MSc student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/">HSE University</a>, actively involved in research at <a href="https://bayesgroup.ru/">Bayesian Methods Research Group</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7HU0UoUAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Dmitry Vetrov</a>. Currently, my research is focused on Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) and their connections to Reinforcement Learning. I am working towards creating new efficient GFlowNet training algorithms, as well as expanding the theoretical understanding of these models. Generally speaking, my research interests include generative modeling and probabilistic methods in deep learning. <br /> <br />
  
I have also previously worked on Neural Radiance Fields and text-to-3D generative models with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q69zIO0AAAAJ&hl=en">Kirill Struminsky</a>, as well as worked on Domain Generalization for my Bachelor's thesis. Prior to joining Bayesian Methods Research Group, I interned at <a href="https://yandex.com/company">Yandex</a>, where I worked on <a href="https://github.com/ytsaurus/ytsaurus">YTsaurus</a> platform.
